| Step | Command       | Explanation                                                                                                                             |
| ---- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    |               | _Clone the project and extract it. In the config folder create "keys_dev.js" file. In that file paste the code given below this table._ |
| 1    |               | _Open terminal in the project root_                                                                                                     |
| 2    | `npm install` | _Install server dependencies_                                                                                                           |
| 3    | `cd client`   | _Open "client" folder_                                                                                                                  |
| 4    | `npm install` | _Install client dependencies_                                                                                                           |
| 5    | `cd ..`       | _Go back to the project's root folder_                                                                                                  |
| 6    | `npm run dev` | _Run the server and the client simultaneously._                                                                                         |
| 7    |               | _Paste "localhost:3000" in the URL. Client runs on port 3000, server on port 5000._                                                     |

Code that needs to be pasted in the keys_dev.js file as described in step 0:

`module.exports = {
  mongoURI:
    "mongodb+srv://fakeuserforgithubpurposes:fakeuserforgithubpurposes@cluster0-awywm.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true",
  secretOrKey: "secret",
  statsCollectionId: "5ce553a8c207983db0e19ef8"
